A working Matlab implementation of the main UKF algorithm capable of replaying flight data can be found here: https://github.com/PX4/ecl/tree/master/matlab/UKF/Phase2

The UKF uses a range of techniques acquired from several years of experience including an original method to handle the delayed time horizon problem. A list of references I have found useful has been included.
